# Burger Kiosk Refactoring Project

Welcome to the Burger Kiosk Refactoring Project repository. This project showcases the refactoring of the Burger Kiosk codebase, guided by principles of design patterns and object-oriented programming. As part of the L5 Software Design & Architecture course assessment, this project demonstrates how applying these principles can lead to improved software design and maintainability.

## Video Explanation

To gain an overview of the improvements made to the Burger Kiosk codebase, watch the [Video Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yourvideoid). In this video, I discuss the evolution of the codebase, how design patterns influenced my decisions, and how these changes lead to a more robust and extensible software solution.

## Knowledge from Study Materials

In preparation for this project, I undertook a comprehensive study of design patterns and their application in software design. By exploring various resources, I gained insights into the significance of design patterns in crafting maintainable and adaptable software systems.

I engaged with a variety of reading materials that collectively enriched my understanding of software design concepts:

- A collection of literature introduced me to the world of design patterns, emphasizing their role in solving recurring software design challenges.

- Additional resources highlighted the importance of clear roles, responsibilities, and collaborations within software components, fostering a holistic understanding of effective software design.

- Through timeless principles of software architecture, I learned how to create software systems that endure and adapt.

## Refactored Code

The refactored code can be explored in the [src](src/) directory. It reflects the successful application of design patterns and object-oriented principles, resulting in a more organized, maintainable, and flexible codebase.

## Getting Started

For instructions on running the refactored code and experiencing the improvements firsthand, please refer to the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section of this README.

## Conclusion

This project represents the culmination of my exploration of design patterns and object-oriented principles. By applying these concepts, I was able to not only address concerns in the original code but also enhance its architecture and long-term viability.
